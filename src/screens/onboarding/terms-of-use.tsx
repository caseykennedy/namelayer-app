        These Terms of Service (the “Terms”) are a binding contract between you
        and Tetra (“Tetra,” “we” and “us”) and establish the rules and
        restrictions that govern your use of our products, services and
        applications, including, but not limited to, (i) our website located at
        www.Tetra.io (the “Site”) and (ii) a digital wallet (the “Wallet” )
        consisting of software developed by us (our “Software”) that permits you
        to self-custody and transact in the Handshake virtual currency (“HNS”)
        participate in domain name auctions and conduct other interactions on
        the Handshake blockchain network (“Handshake” or the “Handshake Network”
        ), and otherwise use HNS on the Handshake network (such products,
        services and applications including the Site and Wallet are
        collectively, the “Services” ). If you have any questions, comments, or
        concerns regarding these Terms or the Services, please contact us at

      <p>
        IF YOU DO NOT AGREE TO ALL OF THE FOLLOWING TERMS, YOU MAY NOT USE OR
        ACCESS THE SERVICES IN ANY MANNER. THESE TERMS CONTAIN A BINDING
        ARBITRATION CLAUSE AND CLASS ACTION WAIVER, WHICH MAY AFFECT YOUR LEGAL
        RIGHTS. PLEASE READ IT CAREFULLY. YOUR USE OF THE SERVICES IN ANY WAY
        MEANS THAT YOU AGREE TO ALL OF THESE TERMS, AND THESE TERMS WILL REMAIN
        IN EFFECT WHILE YOU USE THE SERVICES.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Will these Terms ever change?</strong>
      </p>
      <p>
        We are constantly trying to improve our Services, so we may need to
        change these Terms along with the Services. We reserve the right to
        change the Terms at any time, but if we do, we will bring it to your
        attention by requiring you to log in to our Services again and accept
        the new Terms, and/or by some other means.
      </p>
      <p>
        If you don't agree with the new Terms, you are free to reject them.
        Unfortunately, that means you may not be able to use some of the
        Services. However, we have no access to the HNS in your Wallet, and you
        can always access your HNS using the seed phrase you have used to create
        your Wallet or that was generated with our Software when you created
        your Wallet in any other compatible Handshake Wallet, although we make
        no guarantees on the performance of other Handshake Wallets not
        developed by us. We also cannot prevent you from using prior versions of
        our Wallet to access your HNS if you disagree with new Terms, although
        you may be required to agree to new terms for future iterations of our
        Wallet or other Services.
      </p>
      <p>
        If you use the Services in any way after a change to the Terms is
        effective, that means you agree to all of the changes. Except for
        changes by us as described here, no other amendment or modification of
        these Terms will be effective unless in writing and signed by both you
        and us.

        <strong>Who can use the Services?</strong>
      </p>
      <p>
        By accessing or using our Services, you represent and warrant that you
        are of legal age in your jurisdiction as is required to access such
        Services and enter into arrangements as provided by the Services (or if
        not, you've received your parent's or guardian's permission to use the
        Services and gotten your parent or guardian to agree to these Terms on
        your behalf). If you're agreeing to these Terms on behalf of an
        organization or entity, you represent and warrant that you are
        authorized to agree to these Terms on that organization or entity's
        behalf and bind them to these Terms (in which case, the references to
        “you” and “your” in these Terms, except for in this sentence, refer to
        that organization or entity.). You will only use the Services for your
        own internal, personal use, and not on behalf of or for the benefit of
        any third party, and only in a manner that complies with all laws that
        apply to you. If your use of the Services is prohibited by applicable
        laws or regulations, or you are a citizen, resident, or member of any
        jurisdiction or group that is subject to economic sanctions by the
        United States, then you aren't authorized to use the Services. If
        permits and licenses are required for you to use the Services, you must
        first obtain those prior to such use. We can't and won't be responsible
        for your using the Services in a way that breaks the law or regulations.

        <strong>What about my privacy?</strong>

        .
      </p>
      <p>What are the basics of using Tetra's Services?</p>
      <p>
        Other than the Site, the Services primarily consist of the Wallet that
        can store and transfer HNS and allows users to interact with the
        Handshake Network. The Handshake Network is a decentralized blockchain
        network not developed by us that allows for network participants to
        purchase, sell, acquire and use top-level domain names (“TLDs” ) hosted
        on the Handshake Network. Specifically, Handshake Network participants
        can purchase TLDs by participating in auctions that allow such
        participants to bid on TLDs as part of a Vickrey auction. The owner of a
        Handshake TLD can use its TLD in a variety of ways, including but not
        limited to offering subdomain services, hosting censorship-resistant
        websites, or reselling TLDs to other interested parties. In addition,
        certain users may be eligible to claim HNS that was allocated to them in
        a randomized process by the creators of the Handshake Network. Users of
        our Wallet can claim or transfer HNS and directly participate in
        interactions on the Handshake Network directly from an interface within
        the Wallet.
      </p>
      <p>
        Tetra does not create, host, facilitate, participate, or otherwise
        enable transactions on the Handshake Network and has no control over the
        results of the auctions that occur on the Handshake Network, a user's
        eligibility to receive HNS, transfers between Handshake Network
        participants, or any other activity that occurs on the Handshake
        Network. The Wallet is essentially an interface for users to interact
        directly with Handshake and to self-custody HNS.
      </p>
      <p>
        When you create a Wallet, you will either provide a seed phrase to
        generate that Wallet or a cryptographic private and public key pair will
        be generated. Such private key may be in the form of a mnemonic seed
        phrase. Regardless, the private and public key pair together evidence
        ownership/possession of a specific amount of HNS in that Wallet which
        enables you to send and receive HNS via the Handshake Network. The
        public key is visible to all participants of the Handshake Network. The
        private key must be used to transact the HNS represented by the
        corresponding public key. You will also create a password to access your
        Wallet and your private key as a security or convenience measure. In
        this instance, your password method may function similarly to your
        private key in that it allows you and others in possession of such
        information to potentially transfer HNS from your Wallet if they have
        access to your Wallet. Tetra does not store your private key or any
        similar methods of accessing your private key, and we will never request
        this information.
      </p>
      <p>
        You will be responsible for keeping your hardware devices, including
        your personal computing device or phone, secure and for any activity
        associated with such devices and your Wallet. Tetra will not be
        responsible if someone else accesses your devices and authorizes a
        transaction from your Wallet.
      </p>
      <p>
        Tetra does not have access to your private key or password and cannot
        access your Wallet, initiate a transfer of HNS or otherwise access the
        Handshake Network using your Wallet. We are not your brokers,
        intermediaries, agents, advisors, or custodians, and we do not have a
        fiduciary relationship or obligation to you regarding any other
        decisions or activities that you affect when using your Wallet or our
        Services. We are not responsible for any activities that you engage in
        when using your Wallet, and you should understand the risks associated
        with Virtual Currency, including HNS, described more fully below. Unless
        explicitly provided in writing, we do not host or maintain any
        applications or Handshake services that may be accessible using our
        Services and do not participate in any Handshake transactions,
        recommend, endorse, or otherwise take a position on your use of these
        Services.
      </p>
      <p>
        “<em>Virtual Currency</em>” refers to cryptocurrency, digital currency,
        digital asset, crypto asset or other such similar term describing, for
        example, Ethereum, but does not include a derivative of a virtual
        currency or a security. Virtual Currency is evidenced on, and can be
        electronically transferred using a Blockchain.
      </p>
      <p>
        “<em>Blockchain</em>” refers to a distributed ledger, maintained by a
        network of computers, that records all transactions of Virtual Currency
        in theoretically unchangeable data packages known as blocks, each of
        which are timestamped to reference the previous block, so that the
        blocks are linked in a chain that evidences the entire history of
        transactions of the Virtual Currency.

        Your use of the Services is subject to the following additional
        restrictions:

          Your Responsibilities and Assumption of Risk Associated with Virtual
          Currency and your Wallet
        </strong>
      </p>
      <p>
        In order to be successfully completed, any HNS transaction created with
        or sent to your Wallet must be confirmed and recorded on the Handshake
        Network. Tetra has no control over Handshake and therefore cannot and
        does not ensure that any transaction details you submit or receive via
        our Services will be confirmed on Handshake and does not have the
        ability to facilitate any cancellation or modification requests. In
        addition, certain interactions on Handshake and the use of TLDs may
        involve complex transactions that entail a high degree of risk.
      </p>
      <p>You agree and understand that:</p>
      <ol>
        <li>
          <p>
            You: (a) have the necessary technical expertise and ability to
            review and evaluate the security, integrity and operation of your
            Wallet; (b) have the knowledge, experience, understanding,
            professional advice and information to make your own evaluation of
            the merits, risks and applicable compliance requirements under
            applicable laws of any use of your Wallet; (c) know, understand and
            accept the risks associated with your Wallet; and (d) accept the
            risks associated with Virtual Currency generally, and are
            responsible for conducting your own independent analysis of the
            risks specific to HNS. You further assume and agree that Tetra will
            have no responsibility or liability for such risks. You hereby
            irrevocably waive, release and discharge all claims, whether known
            or unknown to you, against Tetra, its affiliates and their
            respective shareholders, members, directors, officers, employees,
            agents and representatives related to any of the risks set forth
            herein.

            that the loss or destruction of a hardware device you have used our
            Services on or installed the Wallet to may compromise the security
            of your Wallet and HNS and may result in the total loss of HNS.

            evolving. Tetra may rely on advice of counsel concerning the
            application of existing and new legal and regulatory requirements to
            its activities concerning Virtual Currency, which advice may cause

            Handshake. Furthermore, Tetra does not assume responsibility for any
            issues relating to the continuing viability of Handshake, including,
            but not limited to, the ability to retain the technical expertise
            required to support Handshake or the performance of Handshake with
            respect to transaction times.

            Tetra makes no guarantee as to the functionality of Handshake's
            decentralized governance processes, which could, among other things,
            lead to delays, conflicts of interest, or operational decisions that
            are unfavorable to certain owners of HNS. You acknowledge and accept
            that the protocol governing the operation of Handshake may be
            subject to sudden changes in operating rules which may materially
            alter Handshake and affect the value and function of HNS.

      <p>
        You are responsible for all Content you contribute, in any manner, to
        the Services, and you represent and warrant you have all rights
        necessary to do so, in the manner in which you contribute it. You are

      </p>
      <p>
        The Services may contain links or connections to third party websites or
        services that are not owned or controlled by Tetra. In other cases,
        third party websites may integrate with our Services. When you access
        third party websites or use third party services, you accept that there
        are risks in doing so, and that Tetra is not responsible for such risks.
        We encourage you to be aware when you leave the Services and to read the
        terms and conditions and privacy policy of each third-party website or
        service that you visit or utilize.
      </p>
      <p>
        Tetra has no control over, and assumes no responsibility for, the
        content, accuracy, privacy policies, or practices of or opinions

        Your interactions with organizations and/or individuals found on or
        through the Services, including payment and delivery of goods or
        services, financial transactions, and any other terms, conditions,
        warranties or representations associated with such dealings, are solely

        If there is a dispute between participants of the Services, or between
        users and any third party, you agree that Tetra is under no obligation
        to become involved. In the event that you have a dispute with one or
        more other users or third parties, you release Tetra, its officers,

        says: &quot;A general release does not extend to claims that the
        creditor or releasing party does not know or suspect to exist in his or
        her favor at the time of executing the release and that, if known by him
        or her, would have materially affected his or her settlement with the

        <strong>Will Tetra ever change the Services?</strong>
      </p>
      <p>
        We&#39;re always trying to improve the Services, so they may change over
        time. We may suspend or discontinue any part of the Services, or we may
        introduce new features or impose limits on certain
      </p>
      <p>
        features or restrict access to parts or all of the Services. We reserve
        the right to remove any Content from the Services at any time, for any
        reason in our sole discretion, and without notice.

      <p>
        <strong>Do the Services cost anything?</strong>
      </p>
      <p>
        The Tetra Services are currently free, but we reserve the right to
        charge for certain or all Services in the future. We will notify you
        before any Services you are using begin carrying a fee, and if you wish
        to continue using such Services, you must pay all applicable fees for
        such Services.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>What if I want to stop using the Services?</strong>
      </p>
      <p>
        You&#39;re free to do that at any time; please refer to our Privacy
        Policy to understand how we treat information you provide to us after
        you have stopped using our Services.
      </p>
      <p>
        Tetra is also free to terminate (or suspend access to) your use of
        certain of the Services for any reason in our discretion, including your
        breach of these Terms, provided t hat we will never have the ability to
        access your Wallet or transfer your HNS, even in the event we terminate
        your access to our other Services. Tetra has the sole right to decide
        whether you are in violation of any of the restrictions set forth in
        these Terms. If we suspend your use of the Services, you may continue to
        access your Wallet directly or through other services not hosted by us.
      </p>
      <p>
        Provisions that, by their nature, should survive termination of these
        Terms shall survive termination. By way of example, all of the following
        will survive termination: any obligation you have to indemnify us, any
        limitations on our liability, any terms regarding ownership or
        intellectual property rights, and terms regarding disputes between us.

        fraud was the direct cause of any loss to you, and subject to the
        limitations set forth below.

        PRECEDING THIS APPLICABLE CLAIM, OR (C) ANY MATTER BEYOND OUR REASONABLE
        CONTROL. SOME STATES DO NOT ALLOW THE EXCLUSION OR LIMITATION OF CERTAIN
        DAMAGES, SO THE ABOVE LIMITATION AND EXCLUSIONS MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU.

        law, You agree to indemnify and hold Tetra, its affiliates, officers,
        agents, employees, and partners harmless from and against any and all
        claims, liabilities, damages (actual and consequential), losses and
        expenses (including attorneys' fees) arising from or in any way related
        to any third party allegations or claims relating to (a) your use of the
        Services (including any actions taken by a third party using your
        Wallet), and (b) your violation of these Terms. In the event of such an
        allegation, claim, suit, or action (“Claim”), we will attempt to provide
        notice of the Claim to any contact information we have for you, if
        applicable (provided that failure to deliver such notice shall not
        eliminate or reduce your indemnification obligations hereunder).
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Assignment.</strong> You may not assign, delegate or transfer
        these Terms or your rights or obligations hereunder, in any way (by
        operation of law or otherwise) without Tetra's prior written consent. We
        may transfer, assign, or delegate these Terms and our rights and
        obligations without consent.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Choice of Law; Arbitration.</strong> These Terms are governed by
        and will be construed under the laws of the State of California, without
        regard to the conflicts of laws provisions thereof. Any dispute arising
        from or relating to the subject matter of these Terms shall be finally
        settled in San Francisco County, California, in English, in accordance
        with the Streamlined Arbitration Rules and Procedures of Judicial
        Arbitration and Mediation Services, Inc. (“JAMS”) then in effect, by one
        commercial arbitrator with substantial experience in resolving
        intellectual property and commercial contract disputes, who shall be
        selected from the appropriate list of JAMS arbitrators in accordance
        with such Rules. Judgment upon the award rendered by such arbitrator may
        be entered in any court of competent jurisdiction. Notwithstanding the
        foregoing obligation to arbitrate disputes, each party shall have the
        right to pursue injunctive or other equitable relief at any time, from
        any court of competent jurisdiction. For all purposes of this Agreement,
        the parties consent to exclusive jurisdiction and venue in the state or
        federal courts located in, respectively, San Francisco County,
        California, or the Northern District of California. Any arbitration
        under these Terms will take place on an individual basis: class
        arbitrations and class actions are not permitted. YOU UNDERSTAND AND
        AGREE THAT BY ENTERING INTO THESE TERMS, YOU AND Tetra ARE EACH WAIVING
        THE RIGHT TO TRIAL BY JURY OR TO PARTICIPATE IN A CLASS ACTION.

        withholding, filing, and reporting all taxes, duties, and other
        governmental assessments associated with your activity in connection
        with the Services. The failure of either you or us to exercise, in any
        way, any right herein shall not be deemed a waiver of any further rights
        hereunder. If any provision of these Terms is found to be unenforceable
        or invalid, that provision will be limited or eliminated, to the minimum
        extent necessary, so that these Terms shall otherwise remain in full
        force and effect and enforceable. You and Tetra agree that these Terms
        are the complete and exclusive statement of the mutual understanding
        between you and Tetra, and that it supersedes and cancels all previous
        written and oral agreements, communications and other understandings
        relating to the subject matter of these Terms. You hereby acknowledge
        and agree that you are not an employee, agent, partner, or joint venture
